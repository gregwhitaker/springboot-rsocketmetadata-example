# springboot-rsocketmetadata-example
![Build](https://github.com/gregwhitaker/springboot-rsocketmetadata-example/workflows/Build/badge.svg)

An example of sending per-request metadata with [RSocket](http://rsocket.io) and Spring Boot.

## Building the Example
Run the following command to build the example:

    ./gradlew clean build

## Running the Example
Follow the steps below to run the example:

1. Run the following command to start the `hello-service`:

        ./gradlew :hello-service:bootRun
        
2. In a new terminal, run the following command to call the `hello-service` using the `hello-client`:

        ./gradlew :hello-client:bootRun --args="hello Bob"

    If successful, you will see the response message containing the `traceId` and `spanId` metadata printed to the console:

        e.client.hello.HelloClientApplication    : Sending message...
        e.client.hello.HelloClientApplication    : Response: Hello, Bob! [traceId: 'efb0cf0f-ee96-4e41-8777-db67e806323f', spanId: '146967266']
